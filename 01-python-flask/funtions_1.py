'''there is two types of funtions built-in and user-defined

We can create functions to perform specific tasks as per our needs. Such functions are called user-defined functions

These functions are defined and pre-coded in python. Some examples of built-in functions are as follows:
min(), max(), len(), sum(), type(), range(), dict(), list(), tuple(), set(), print(), etc.
